This exercise introduces concepts from chapter 4 - section 3 of the Using Thymeleaf manual.

A bean of class Customer has been set into the context model with variable name customer. This is a complex bean,
 containing properties of the Gender PaymentMethod enum types.
Edit the source code in order to bind bean fields into form fields. You have to use th:object and th:field attributes.
As this exercise is more complex than previous ones, some hints have been written as HTML comments inside the template.
After trying a solution, look a the Generated source to see how field elements are populated.
In particular, see the input hidden element for the 'id' field.
You can finally press the 'Submit' button to see how the form values are sent to the server.
You can check the proposed solution by pressing the Show solution button () above the code editor.
